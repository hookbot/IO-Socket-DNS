 - Compatibilty fixes for various versions of Perl and
   various platforms, such as Linux, Mac, Windows.
 - Allow client to function even without Net::DNS.
 - Add "nslookup" emergency spawn support so the client
   IO::Socket::DNS no longer requires Net::DNS.
 - Bootstrap all downloaded client software with its
   specified DNS Suffix burnt into the program.
 - Can now import Net::DNS from the server side via the
   nslookup command: nslookup -type=TXT nslookup.SUFFIX
 - For convenience, IO::Socket::DNS->resolver will now
   automatically import Net::DNS on demand.
 - Add dnsnetcat utility much like dnstelnet but allows
   direct TCP I/O by using the real "nc" program.
 - For security reasons, dnsssh now honors the normal
   known_hosts and allows StrictHostKeyChecking again.
 - Add download progress status to Menu so you don't
   get as confused or bored waiting that first time.
