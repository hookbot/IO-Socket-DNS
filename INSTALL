INSTALLATION
============

CLIENT DEPENDENCIES

There are no true dependencies in order to use this module.
In fact, this module itself (IO::Socket::DNS) does not need to
be installed in order to use it. It can bootstrap itself by
downloading itself through DNS queries to the server.
You may pre-install this to avoid this bootstrap mechanism.

See "perldoc dnsc" for more details.

SERVER DEPENDENCIES

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

1. The server requires Net::DNS 0.67 or higher.

2. You will need access to a real domain or at least access to be
able to delegate a domain for a real domain away to the server.

3. You also probably need root access on another server in order to
bind to port 53 which is a privileged low port.

4. You will probably also need a dedicated IP or at least be able
to forward the specified sub zone to the IO::Socket::DNS::Server.

See "perldoc dnsd" for more details.
