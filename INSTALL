INSTALLATION
============

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

CLIENT DEPENDENCIES

The client only requires Net::DNS to be installed.
Actually, this module (IO::Socket::DNS) does not even need to be
installed for the client to operate. It can bootstrap itself by
downloading the module through DNS queries to the server.

See "perldoc dnsc" for more details.

SERVER DEPENDENCIES

1. The server requires Net::DNS 0.62 or higher and this module.

2. You will need access to a real domain or at least access to be
able to delegate a domain for a real domain away to the server.

3. You also probably need root access on another server in order to
bind to port 53 which is a privileged low port.

4. You will probably also need a dedicated IP or at least be able
to forward the specified sub zone to the IO::Socket::DNS::Server.

See "perldoc dnsd" for more details.
